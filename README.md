# AutoSilent
AutoSilent is an Android Application that allows user to customize their ringer settings either based on location or time.

```
Minimum Api Level - Lollipop (5.1)
Maximum Api Level - Pie      (9.0)
```
# Installation
1. Clone the git repository
    ```
    https://github.com/fsuleman2/AutoSilent.git
    ```
2. Open the folder in Android Studio and complete the gradle sync. Gradle will take care to download all the dependencies

3. Create you own account on Google Firebase, add your project id and replace the maps_api_key that you get in the google_api_key.xml

4. Debug the application to execute
# Pre Requisites
A working knowledge of these will help you out a lot more and make the program more easier to read:

1. Google Firebase
2. Google Location API


# Important Note:
I built this project from scratch and learnt a lot. Some of the things you will learn by using this project as a guideline are, Java for Android, Location API's, Google Services API, SQLITE, Gradle (for handling various dependencies). Also using web services one can build scalable systems while keeping efficiency in consideration. Best of luck. Also --
**The project utilises Google Web API's extensively and several key components will be redacted later on to prevent key leaks. Since this is a demo for now, all the files have been included. As components are removed. I shall include a tutorial to code those components from scratch.**


# Key Screenshots
##  1. Time Controlled Ringer Settings

**Here based on the time ranger set. The phone gets silent in the time and once the timer expires,the phone is then reverted to normal mode**



## 2. Location Controlled Ringer Settings

**Here once a paticular location is marked on the map. The location name is displayed to the user and the location is added to the database later on if  the add geofence button is clicked**


## 3. Firebase List in the App

**Here the location is extracted from the Google Firebase and geofences are active. If a person comes within a 400m radius of the location, the phone becomes silent. Once the user exits the location, the phone becomes normal again.**

## 4. Firebase Data Model
